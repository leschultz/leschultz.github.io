    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented machine learning model ensemble for property prediction and uncertainty quantification of materials data
        \item Quantified the feature space of the model using kernel density estimation to identify regions where the model's predictions were less accurate.
        \item Wrote PyPI package for users to apply machine learning models that flag improper predictions
    \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scientific Cluster Construction and Administration}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assisted in the construction and administration of two clusters
